Learning multiple programming languages and paradigms is analogous to world travel in the sense that you are challenged to expand your point-of-view and see how other cultures work.

### The Goal
While not the only goal, usually a goal of traveling is to see how people in other cultures live.  "Oh, you guys decided to drive on the other side of the road - interesting."  "So... dessert here is made with beans?"  "Wait - why does this toilet have two buttons?"  Then sometimes you leave and think, "Why don't the desserts at home have beans in them?  That was delicious!"  That's the kind of moment that learning a new programming language should provide.  That's the goal.

It's all about creating a moment where you think something along the lines of, "Ahh, so when presented with the challenge of concurrency, this culture decided to eschew direct use of threads, shared memory, and thread-safe data structures, and instead chose to use message passing between actors which can run concurrently.  Interesting."  This is called learning - and learning is good.


### Taking the trip
You could probably learn a lot about another country without getting on a plane, but it is not the same as going there.  You're going to be looking in from the outside.  You won't be immersed in the unfamiliar culture.  Likewise, it's not enough to read an article about some new technology, you've got to try it.  Don't get me wrong, reading about new technology is great, but in my opinion it's not a good idea to form a strong opinion about a technology without trying it.

You have to BUILD something.  Ideally it's a project that, you know, serves a purpose.  This is why working on side projects is so great.  They're a chance to learn something new while building something useful.  It's better if the project is something non-trivial.  Starting with a small, 1-file script is great, but I think you should really solve a bigger problem with your newfound tool.  Working on something very small doesn't give you a chance to get in to the details of a language.  It's similar to having a layover at an airport in a new country.  Sure you were there, you probably got a quick bite somewhere that made native-style food, but you didn't immerse yourself in the culture by any means.  Commit to completing the project and push through problems that you may encounter.  It's this kind of approach which helps to create learning moments.


### Your brain is the best tool for the job
Sometimes people will say that polyglotism makes it possible to use the best tool for the job.  And, I mean, I guess that's fine.  I don't entirely agree with that sentiment.  First it implies that, you know, there is a single "best tool for the job".  Programmers like to think that there's always a correct answer (and that they're able to find it).  But I actually think there's a significant amount of "art" involved in software engineering.  There are certainly plenty of wrong tools for a job, but there are also many "right" tools.

But more importantly, the goal of polyglot programming is not to choose the right tool for the job, it's about being able to bend your mind to look at the problem at hand in a new way.  As programmers, our brain is the primary tool, not the language.  Polyglotism is about improving the quality of your brain-tool.


### Rack up the frequent flyer miles
Similar to traveling, the farther you go the more likely you are to learn something new.  If you know Java really well, experimenting with C# is fine.  You might learn something, but the learnings are more likely to be shallow and uninteresting.  "Oh, so you guys say 'using' instead of 'import' ... okay."  That's an over-simplification, but hopefully you get my point.  Learning a language that is highly similar to one you already know is like leaving one American metropolitan city and going to visit another American metropolitan city.  Maybe the streets are laid out differently and the region may specialize in a different style of food, but are you really learning something about a different culture?


### Get out there
So, travel the world, learn some new things, and become a better programmer in the general sense.

### Concepts
X change your mind & changes your perspective
X polyglot -> best tool for the job (fine, but IMO not the main benefit)
X the "right way" is different in different cultures - how do you reconcile that?
- successful projects and companies are built with very different technology stacks and outlooks - clearly it is possible to be successful with different approaches.
X length of visit & depth
  X bouncing in, learning syntax and bouncing out is akin to reading the wikipedia page for a travel destination.
  X really have to spend some time there - build something "real", not a tutorial, not a single algorithm thing, but a program that solves a real non-trivial problem.
  X side projects are so important
X how different can you get? different paradigms (traveling from one american metropolitan area to another does not tend to lead to ground-breaking insights or really have an impact on your world view) (similarly java->c# is not going to teach you much)

- be a polyglot programmer - stretch your mind, don't use 10 languages to build 1 thing, don't use 10 languages in your company and require everyone to learn all of them for various things, stress out people in ops, complicate deployments, etc.
X this is a personal thing - will make you a better programmer in whatever language you use for a given project
