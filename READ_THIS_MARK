When cloning to a new machine you actually need to run:
  rake setup_github_pages

in order to be able to deploy back to github.  This sets up the weird
situation where the _deploy directory on the source branch holds a
copy of the same git repository but checked out to the master branch.  Then,
when running 'rake generate' from the source branch it will deploy to the
_deploy directory.  Running 'rake deploy' will basically cd in to that
directory and do the committing & pushing.  So, the directory tree should
look like this:

(source branch)/
(source branch)/Rakefile (and all the other octopress stuff)
(source branch)/_deploy
(source branch)/_deploy/(master branch)
(source branch)/_deploy/(master branch)/assets (and all other blog stuff)

Another way of checking is, from the top directory on the source branch:

$ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/source
$ cat _deploy/.git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master

If that second command fails, you probably need to run:
  rake setup_github_pages
